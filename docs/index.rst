torchlearning-benchmark
==================================================

This **torchlearning-benchmark** is designed for generalized supervised learning tasks on PyTorch. It provides complete support for supervised learning pipeline including:
* Data set managing
* Learning and testing on multiple data set simultaneously
* Complete customize options for data sampler, batch sampler, collate function in data loader
* Data transform registry, managing and building and build-in transform options
* Modeling support, build-in architecture backbone
* Evaluation pipeline managing
* Target structure managing and build-in structures
* Versatile solver customization options, all optimizers and learn rate schedulers in PyTorch are available in torchlearning-benchmark
* Learning pipeline managing, logging support and tensorboard support
* Checkpointing of learning, for both models and optimizers.
* Configuration system
